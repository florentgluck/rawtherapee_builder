# Description

A simple Dockerfile to build the latest dev branch of RawTherapee.

Beware that the archive generated by the container is targetting an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS system. It hasn't been tested on other distributions or other Ubuntu versions. Given that it depends on Ubuntu 20.04's glibc version, a system with a different version won't be able to run it.

# Usage

Simply run `make` to display the description of the supported targets:

```
Supported targets:
	build		builds an image with RawTherapee's source code and a tarball of the installation files
	tarball		copies the tarball of the installation files to the current directory
	inspect		runs a shell in the container to inspects RawTherapee's sources and tarball
	install		installs TARBALL to INSTALL_DIR on the host
	clean		delete TARBALL
	mrproper	delete TARBALL and delete the container image

Where:
	TARBALL is the env. variable that specifies the name of the tarball archive
	Current TARBALL value: rawtherapee.tar.gz
	INSTALL_DIR is the env. variable that specifies where RawTherapee must be installed
	Current INSTALL_DIR value: ~/.local

Usage examples:
- Creates rawtherapee.tar.gz (default name) from RawTherapee's installation files and installs it into ~/.local (default installation dir.) on the host:
  $ make install
- Creates rt.tgz from RawTherapee's installation files and installs it into /tmp on the host:
  $ make TARBALL=rt.tgz INSTALL_DIR=/tmp install
```

# Remark

RawTherapee requires the `libiptcdata0` library. To install it, simply run:

```
sudo apt install -y libiptcdata0 
```
