# Description

A simple Dockerfile to build the latest dev branch of RawTherapee.

Beware that the archive generated by the container is targetting an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS system. It hasn't been tested on other distributions or other Ubuntu versions. Given that it depends on Ubuntu 20.04's glibc version, a system with a different version won't be able to run it.

# Usage

To build RawTherapee's latest dev version and create the `rawtherapee.tar.gz` archive with its distribution files, run:

```
make
```

To inspect RawTherapee's git repository and source code, run:

```
make inspect
```

# Deploying on the host

To deploy the generated `rawtherapee.tar.gz` file onto the host system, simply decompress and de-archive it.
For instance, to extract it to `~/rawtherapee`, type:

```
tar fxz -C $HOME rawtherapee.tar.gz
```

Please note that you will probably need to install the libiptcdata0 library. To do so, simply run:

```
sudo apt install -y libiptcdata0 
```
