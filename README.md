# Description

A simple Dockerfile to build the latest dev branch of RawTherapee.

Beware that the archive generated by the container is targetting an Ubuntu 20.04 LTS system. It hasn't been tested on other distributions or other Ubuntu versions. Given that it depends on Ubuntu 20.04's glibc version, a system with a different version won't be able to run it.

# Usage

Simply run `make` to display the description of the supported targets:

```
Supported targets:
	build		builds the container image
	archive		builds the RawTherapee archive rawtherapee.tar.gz in the current directory
	inspect		runs a shell in the build container and inspects the source contents
	install		installs rawtherapee.tar.gz to /home/gluckf/.local
	clean		delete rawtherapee.tar.gz
	mrproper	delete rawtherapee.tar.gz and delete the container image

Where:
	ARCHIVE is the env. variable that specifies the name of the archive
	INSTALL_DIR is the env. variable that specifies the installation directory

Usage example:
The command below builds RawTherapee as the rt.tgz archive, then it installs it into ~/.local:
make ARCHIVE=rt.tgz INSTALL_DIR=~/.local install
```

# Remark

RawTherapee requires the `libiptcdata0` library. To install it, simply run:

```
sudo apt install -y libiptcdata0 
```
